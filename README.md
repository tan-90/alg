# alg

Unicorns and rainbows! alg is short for **AL**most or**G** and is inspired by, for now actually copied from, emacs' [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) (that one is the unicorn). It's meant to describe a document format and set of editing tools for authoring documents and organizing tasks in the form of a [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension.

alg is a thing because I'm too stubborn to stop reinventing the wheel, but some original ideas will become a thing in due time. Also, alg will become a superset of markdown (not because it's better than org's format, simply because I want to).
